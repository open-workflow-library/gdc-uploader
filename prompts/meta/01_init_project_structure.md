üß± Initialize or Conform to Prompt-Based Scientific Workflow Project Structure

This is a prompt for the coding assistant.Its goal is to ensure the project follows the standard structure for a Python-based, prompt-first scientific workflow toolkit.

üéØ Objectives

Create or conform the current repository to match the structure below.

Do not delete existing files, but move/rename/reorganize as needed.

Use .md files in prompts/ as the source of truth for emitting:

.cwl files to artifacts/cwl/

Dockerfiles to artifacts/docker/

.qmd Quarto notebooks to artifacts/notebooks/

üìÇ Target Project Structure

prompts/                  # Human-written prompt definitions (.md)
src/
  your_project/
    __init__.py
    emit/
      cwl.py              # Generates CWL tool definitions from prompt
      docker.py           # Generates Dockerfiles
      notebook.py         # Generates .qmd notebooks
    parser.py             # Parses .md prompt to Python dict
    cli.py                # Optional command-line interface
artifacts/
  cwl/                    # Emitted CWL tools
  docker/                 # Emitted Dockerfiles
  notebooks/              # Emitted .qmd notebooks
notebooks/                # Optional hand-authored or demo notebooks
tests/                    # Unit tests
docs/                     # Quarto or Markdown documentation
README.md
pyproject.toml
LICENSE
plans/                    # Agent-generated plans (.plan.md) for review or execution

‚ùå Restrictions

Do not use Jinja2 or any templating engine.

Use plain Python string formatting (f-strings or .format() only).

All notebooks must use .qmd format, not .ipynb.

‚úÖ Success Criteria

After running, the repo has the correct structure.

Sample emitters and parser files exist in src/your_project/.

At least one example prompt in prompts/ exists (e.g. example_tool.md).

Emitted .cwl, .Dockerfile, and .qmd files land in the right artifacts/ subfolders.

üìì Plan Emission Instructions

The agent must generate a detailed plan before making changes.

Plans must be written to the plans/ folder using the filename format {name}.plan.md.

Each plan should include:

A summary of goals

A list of steps to be taken

Any assumptions or constraints

Optional shell commands or code references

Plans should be idempotent and reviewable.

If a plan already exists, update it only if needed, and note the changes.

üöÄ Emit All Artifacts from Prompt Files

This prompt tells the coding assistant to locate all .md prompt files in the prompts/ directory, parse them, and emit:

.cwl files into artifacts/cwl/

Dockerfiles into artifacts/docker/

.qmd Quarto notebooks into artifacts/notebooks/

üîç Steps

Loop through all .md files in prompts/.

Parse:

Metadata (tool name, docker image, inputs/outputs)

Command block (bash code)

Notebook sections (headers + content)

For each prompt:

Emit a .cwl tool definition

Emit a Dockerfile

Emit a .qmd notebook with demo and docs

‚ùå Constraints

Do not emit if an up-to-date artifact already exists unless instructed to overwrite.

Use only plain Python, not Jinja2 or other template engines.

Output paths:

artifacts/cwl/{tool}.cwl

artifacts/docker/{tool}.Dockerfile

artifacts/notebooks/{tool}.qmd

üß† Assumptions

The prompt structure is consistent and parseable.

A parser.py module exists to convert .md to a structured Python dict.

Emitters exist in src/your_project/emit/.
