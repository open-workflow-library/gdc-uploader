# Agent 1 Progress Report: Core Architecture Designer

## Status: COMPLETE ✅

## Completed Tasks

### 1. ✅ Analyzed Existing Upload Implementations
- Discovered that the current implementation uses shell scripts, not Python files
- Identified four main upload patterns:
  - `gdc_upload.sh` - Main parallel upload using GNU parallel
  - `gdc_upload_single.sh` - Single file upload with progress monitoring
  - `gdc_direct-upload.sh` - Direct minimal wrapper
  - Utility scripts for metadata processing

### 2. ✅ Created Interface Specifications
Created comprehensive interface definitions in `specs/interfaces/`:
- `base_uploader_interface.py` - Core abstract base class with:
  - File discovery interface
  - Upload execution methods
  - Progress tracking hooks
  - Report generation interface
- `exceptions_interface.py` - Complete exception hierarchy with:
  - Error codes (E100-E899)
  - Specific exceptions for each failure type
  - Exit code mapping for CLI
- `plugin_interface.py` - Plugin architecture with:
  - Strategy pattern implementation
  - Automatic plugin discovery
  - Feature-based selection
  - Configuration schema helpers

### 3. ✅ Implemented Core Components
Created production-ready implementations in `src/gdc_uploader/core/`:
- `base_uploader.py` - Abstract base class implementation with:
  - Template method pattern for upload workflow
  - Built-in file discovery strategies
  - Progress reporting callbacks
  - Comprehensive type hints and documentation
- `exceptions.py` - Full exception hierarchy matching the interface
- `plugins.py` - Complete plugin system with:
  - Singleton registry pattern
  - Decorator-based registration
  - Environment validation
  - Feature-based plugin selection

### 4. ✅ Created Example Implementations
Demonstrated in `specs/interfaces/example_implementations.py`:
- **ParallelGDCClientUploader**: Shows how the main uploader would use the interfaces
- **SingleFileUploader**: Demonstrates single file upload with progress monitoring
- **APIParallelUploader**: Example of HTTP API-based uploads
- Each example includes full plugin registration and feature declaration

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Architecture Pattern: Strategy + Plugin
- Used strategy pattern for different upload methods
- Plugin system allows dynamic registration and discovery
- Feature-based selection enables automatic uploader choice

### 2. File Discovery Abstraction
- Created `FileDiscoveryStrategy` interface for flexible file finding
- Implemented `StandardFileDiscovery` with hierarchical search
- Supports both structured and flat file organizations

### 3. Progress Monitoring
- Callback-based progress reporting for flexibility
- `UploadProgress` dataclass provides structured progress data
- Supports both real-time and batch progress updates

### 4. Error Handling
- Comprehensive exception hierarchy with error codes
- Each exception carries contextual information
- Exit codes mapped for CLI compatibility

### 5. Type Safety
- Full type hints throughout the codebase
- Dataclasses for structured data
- Enums for constants (UploadStatus, UploaderType)

## Interface Coordination Points

### For Other Agents:

1. **Agent 2 (Shell Migration)**:
   - Use `ParallelGDCClientUploader` as reference
   - Implement `get_upload_command()` to generate shell commands
   - Map exit codes using `ExitCodes` class

2. **Agent 3 (API Implementation)**:
   - Extend `BaseUploader` for API-based uploads
   - Use `ThreadPoolExecutor` for parallelism
   - Implement chunked uploads in `upload_file()`

3. **Agent 4 (CWL Integration)**:
   - Use plugin system to select appropriate uploader
   - Map CWL inputs to uploader configuration
   - Generate reports in CWL-compatible format

4. **Agent 5 (Testing)**:
   - Mock `BaseUploader` methods for unit tests
   - Use `FileEntry` and `UploadResult` for test data
   - Test plugin registration and discovery

## Code Quality

- ✅ SOLID principles followed
- ✅ Comprehensive type hints
- ✅ Detailed docstrings for all public APIs
- ✅ Designed for testability (dependency injection, interfaces)
- ✅ Backwards compatibility considered (plugin system allows old and new)

## Next Steps for Other Agents

1. Import core modules: `from gdc_uploader.core import BaseUploader, FileEntry, UploadResult`
2. Register uploaders using: `@register_uploader(UploaderType.YOUR_TYPE)`
3. Implement abstract methods from `BaseUploader`
4. Use exception classes from `gdc_uploader.core.exceptions`
5. Follow the examples in `example_implementations.py`

## Summary

The core architecture is complete and ready for other agents to build upon. The design is:
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new upload strategies
- **Maintainable**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Testable**: Interfaces and dependency injection
- **Type-safe**: Full type annotations
- **Well-documented**: Comprehensive docstrings and examples
