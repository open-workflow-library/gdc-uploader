# c6id.large Cost Analysis

## Instance Specifications

| Instance | vCPUs | RAM | Network | Local NVMe | On-Demand $/hr | Spot $/hr |
|----------|-------|-----|---------|------------|----------------|-----------|
| c6id.large | 2 | 4 GB | Up to 12.5 Gbps | 118 GB | $0.1008 | ~$0.035 |
| c6id.xlarge | 4 | 8 GB | Up to 12.5 Gbps | 237 GB | $0.2016 | ~$0.07 |

## Critical Issue: Storage Size

**c6id.large has only 118 GB local NVMe**
- Your BAM files: 228 GB
- **Won't fit!** ❌

## Alternative: c6id.large with EBS

If we add EBS for the BAM:

### On-Demand
- c6id.large: $0.1008/hr × 20h = $2.02
- 250GB EBS: $0.08/hr × 20h = $1.60
- **Total: $3.62** (48% savings)

### Spot
- c6id.large spot: $0.035/hr × 20h = $0.70
- 250GB EBS: $0.08/hr × 20h = $1.60
- **Total: $2.30** (67% savings)

## Resource Check

Your current usage on c5.xlarge shows:
- ~30% CPU = ~1.2 vCPUs used
- ~2GB RAM used

**c6id.large resources**:
- 2 vCPUs ✅ (sufficient)
- 4GB RAM ✅ (sufficient)
- 118GB storage ❌ (insufficient)

## Cost Comparison

| Instance | Storage | On-Demand $/BAM | Spot $/BAM | Issue |
|----------|---------|-----------------|------------|-------|
| Current setup | 1TB EBS | $7.02 | - | Baseline |
| c6id.large | Local only | - | - | Won't fit |
| c6id.large | +250GB EBS | $3.62 | $2.30 | Works |
| **c6id.xlarge** | Local only | $4.03 | **$1.40** | Best value |
| c6i.large | +250GB EBS | $3.42 | $2.10 | Alternative |

## Network Performance Consideration

Both c6id.large and c6id.xlarge have:
- "Up to 12.5 Gbps" network
- But large has lower baseline bandwidth
- Might extend upload time slightly

## Recommendations

### For 228GB BAM files:

1. **Best Option: c6id.xlarge spot ($1.40)**
   - Fits on local NVMe
   - No EBS needed
   - 80% savings

2. **Second Best: c6i.large spot + 250GB EBS ($2.10)**
   - Still 70% savings
   - Requires EBS management

3. **Avoid c6id.large**
   - Storage too small
   - Adding EBS negates the benefit
   - c6id.xlarge is better value

### For Smaller Files (<100GB):

c6id.large would be perfect:
- 100GB BAM on c6id.large spot: ~$0.60
- Incredible value for smaller files

## Conclusion

For your 228GB BAM files, **c6id.xlarge remains the best choice** because:
- Local storage eliminates EBS costs
- Same network performance as .large
- Only $0.035/hr more on spot
- Saves $0.90 per BAM vs c6id.large+EBS

The 118GB local storage on c6id.large is the dealbreaker for your use case.
